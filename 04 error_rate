-- Error Rate Analysis: Identify the percentage of subscriptions that encountered a payment submission error
-- Goal: Identify subscriptions with status_id = 0 (payment errors) to track long term error trends or system issues in the payment process.
-- Logic:
-- Used DISTINCT to ensure that each subscription is only counted once, since it's possible a subscription can hit the error status multiple times.
-- This prevents overcounting and ensures an accurate error rate.

with error_subs as (
select 
    distinct subscription_id
from 
    public.payment_status_log
where 
    status_id =0 
)
-- Final calculation: percentage of subscriptions that encountered at least one error (distinct status_id = 0). Numerator = subs with error /denominator = total subs
select 
    count(error.subscription_id) * 100 / count (subs.subscription_id ) as perc_subs_hit_error 
from 
    public.subscriptions subs 
left join
    error_subs error 
    on subs.subscription_id = error.subscription_id
